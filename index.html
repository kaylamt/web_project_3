          You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental
          missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate
          polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your
          favorite book.</p>

              and
              highly
              underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be
              sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph place__paragraph_sub">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first
              European settlers on US
              territory in
              the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy
              backpack
              from for your 3-month expedition. </p>

              Hampshire. As
              serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to
              the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph place__paragraph_main">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it

              some
              extra
              footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
              from
              this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof
              boots
              to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through
              the

              been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.</p>

              contemporary means of
              transmitting energy. So we
              figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you
              see
              through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

              from
              time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most
              famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war,
              Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph place__paragraph_main">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't
              already guessed, can be
              summed up
              by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the
              tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in
              the
              National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>

              is
              a truly

              which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only
              thing
              shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is
              waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests
              you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller
